                        The General Assembly is a United Nations (UN) body made up of all 193 member states of the organization. It is the main deliberative, policy-making and representative organ of the UN, and serves as a forum for member states to discuss and coordinate on international issues. The General Assembly meets once a year in a regular session, and additional special sessions can be called as needed. 

                        The General Assembly was established in 1945, along with the other main organs of the UN, in the aftermath of World War II. Its purpose was to provide a forum for member states to address global issues and work towards international cooperation and peace. The General Assembly is governed by the UN Charter, which sets out its powers and functions.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        The General Assembly is composed of all member states of the UN, each of which has one vote. Decisions on most issues are made by a two-thirds majority, although some important issues, such as amendments to the UN Charter, require a three-fourths majority. The General Assembly also has six main committees that deal with specific issues, such as disarmament and international security, economic and financial matters, and social, humanitarian, and cultural affairs.
                        <br><br>
                        The General Assembly has several important functions, including the ability to discuss and make recommendations on any matter within the scope of the UN Charter. It can also consider and approve the UN budget, and elect the members of the International Court of Justice and the non-permanent members of the Security Council. The General Assembly also plays a role in the admission of new member states to the UN and the suspension of member states from the organization.
                    

                        The General Assembly holds a number of meetings and events throughout the year, including the annual General Debate, in which heads of state and government deliver statements on the current international situation. It also holds thematic debates on specific issues, such as sustainable development or peace and security. The General Assembly also elects a President for each session, who is responsible for guiding the work of the Assembly and maintaining order during meetings.

    <!-- Summary-->
    <section id="quote"> 
        The General Assembly plays a vital role in the work of the UN and in international relations. It provides a forum for member states to come together and address global challenges, and serves as a platform for international cooperation and the promotion of peace and stability around the world. The Assembly's decisions and resolutions are non-binding, but they carry significant moral and political weight and can help to shape international policy and shape global opinion on important issues.

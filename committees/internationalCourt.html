                        The International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, is the principal judicial body of the United Nations (UN). It is located at the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands. The ICJ settles legal disputes between states and gives advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UN or its specialized agencies.

                        The ICJ is composed of 15 judges elected to nine-year terms by the General Assembly and the Security Council of the UN. The ICJ is assisted by a Registry, which is responsible for the administration of the court. The judges are elected from a list of candidates nominated by the national groups in the Permanent Court of Arbitration, in accordance with a special agreement between the UN and the Netherlands.

                        <br><br>
                        The ICJ has two types of jurisdiction: contentious and advisory. Controversial jurisdiction is the power of the ICJ to settle legal disputes between states. This can be done either through a special agreement between the states concerned or through the declaration of states recognizing the jurisdiction of the ICJ. Advisory jurisdiction is the power of the ICJ to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UN or its specialized agencies.

                        The ICJ has played a significant role in the development of international law and the resolution of international disputes. It has made important contributions to the resolution of disputes involving a wide range of issues, including territorial and boundary disputes, disputes relating to the use of force and the law of the sea, and disputes involving human rights and the environment.
                        <br><br>
                        The ICJ has made a substantial contribution to the development and strengthening of the international legal order. It has helped to clarify and interpret the provisions of international conventions and other sources of international law, and has contributed to the development of international legal principles through its judicial decisions. The ICJ has also played a key role in the peaceful settlement of disputes between states, and has helped to maintain international peace and security.
